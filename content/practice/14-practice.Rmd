A firm has short-run costs given by:
$$\begin{align*}
C(q)&=q^2+1\\
MC(q)&=2q\\ \end{align*}$$


## 1. 
Write an equation for fixed costs, $f$.

## 2.
Write an equation for variable costs, $VC(q)$.

## 3.
Write an equation for average fixed costs, $AFC(q)$.

## 4.
Write an equation for average variable costs, $AVC(q)$.

## 5.
Write an equation for average (total) costs, $AC(q)$.

## 6.
Suppose the firm is in a competitive market, and the current market price is $4, how many units of output maximize profits?

## 7.
How much profit will this firm earn?

## 8.
At what market price would the firm break even $(\pi=0)$?

## 9.
Below what market price would the firm shut down in the short run if it were earning losses?

## 10.
Write out the firm's short run supply function.
