</ul>
<p>Please write your answers to the following questions on a piece of paper, or download and print a PDF copy (link above) to write on. You may also type your answers and print out a hard copy.</p>
<p>You may work together (and I highly encourage that) but you must turn in your own answers. Your TA, under my supervision, will grade homeworks 70% for completion, and for the remaining 30%, pick one question to grade for accuracy - so it is best that you try every problem, even if you are unsure how to complete it accurately.</p>
<h2 id="concepts-and-critical-thinking">Concepts and Critical Thinking</h2>
<p>Please answer the following questions briefly (1-3 sentences). Use examples as necessary. Be sure to label graphs fully, if appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="question-1">Question 1</h3>

<h3 id="question-2">Question 2</h3>
<p>Under what conditions can the law of demand be violated (however theoretical)?</p>

<p>For each of the following pairs, which of the two goods is more likely to have a <em>low</em> price elasticity of demand (less elastic) and why?</p>
<h4 id="part-a">Part A</h4>
<p>Demand for tangerines vs. demand for fruit</p>

<p>Draw a smooth approximation of Alice’s Engel curve for books, and indicate the range(s) of income over which books are <em>normal</em> and/or <em>inferior</em> goods.</p>
<h2 id="quantitative-applications">Quantitative Applications</h2>
<p>Show all work for calculations. You may lose points, even if correct, for missing work. Be sure to label graphs fully, if appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="question-5">Question 5</h3>
<p>Steve spends his disposable income on meals at restaurants <span class="math inline">\((r)\)</span> and paperback novels <span class="math inline">\((n)\)</span>. His usual restaurant meal costs $25, and paperback books cost $8. When Steve’s monthly income is $240, he goes out to eat 8 times and purchases 5 books. When his income rises to $282, he goes out to eat 10 times and purchases 4 books.</p>
<h4 id="part-a-1">Part A</h4>
<p>Calculate the income elasticity for meals at restaurants <span class="math inline">\((r)\)</span>. Is this an inferior, necessity, or luxury good?</p>
<h4 id="part-b-1">Part B</h4>
<p>Calculate the income elasticity for paperback novels <span class="math inline">\((n)\)</span>. Is this an inferior, necessity, or luxury good?</p>
<h3 id="question-6">Question 6</h3>
<p>Kendra buys eggs <span class="math inline">\((e)\)</span>, bagels <span class="math inline">\((b)\)</span>, and coffee <span class="math inline">\((c)\)</span> for breakfast for the week.</p>
<h4 id="part-a-2">Part A</h4>
<p>When eggs are $2/carton, she buys 5 bagels. When the price of eggs falls to $1/carton, she buys 4 bagels. Calculate the cross-price elasticity between eggs and bagels. Are they complements or substitutes for Kendra?</p>
<h4 id="part-b-2">Part B</h4>
<p>When eggs are $2/carton, she buys 3 cups of coffee. When the price of eggs falls to $1/carton, she buys 6 cups of coffee. Calculate the cross-price elasticity between eggs and coffee. Are they complements or substitutes for Kendra?</p>
<h3 id="question-7">Question 7</h3>
<p>Sketch a graph showing a <em>decrease</em> in the price of a good (on the horizontal axis, e.g. <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> if you want). Indicate the (real) income effect, substitution effect, and price effect on the graph. Labelling points and describing each effect as a movement between specific points is sufficient.</p>
<h3 id="question-8">Question 8</h3>
<p>The demand for gym memberships is given by
<span class="math display">\[q_D=500-5p\]</span></p>
<h4 id="part-a-3">Part A</h4>
<p>Write the inverse demand function.</p>
<h4 id="part-b-3">Part B</h4>
<p>Calculate the price elasticity of demand at a price of $80. Is this relatively elastic or relatively inelastic?</p>
<h4 id="part-c-1">Part C</h4>
<p>What is the total revenue at a price of $80?</p>
<h4 id="part-d-1">Part D</h4>
<p>Calculate the price elasticity of demand at a price of $10. Is this relatively elastic or relatively inelastic?</p>
<h4 id="part-e">Part E</h4>
<p>What is the total revenue at $10?</p>
<h4 id="part-f">Part F</h4>
<p>At what price is demand unit elastic, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_D=-1\)</span>?</p>
<h4 id="part-g">Part G</h4>
<p>What is the total revenue at the price you find in part (f)?</p>
