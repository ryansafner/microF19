.pull-right[

- Any firm with market power seeks to maximize profits

- Wants to (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;) **create** a surplus and then *extract* some of it as profit
  - i.e. convert .blue[consumer surplus] into .green[profit]

- Consumers are *still* better off than without the firm because it creates value (.blue[consumer surplus])
  - Just not as *best*-off as under perfect competition

# Price Discrimination

.pull-left[

- The most obvious way to capture more surplus is to raise prices
  - But **Law of Demand** `\(\implies\)` this would turn many customers away!

- Instead, if firm could charge **different** customers with *different WTP* **different** prices, firm could convert more consumer surplus into profit

- ".shout[Price discrimination]" or ".shout[Variable pricing"]&lt;sup&gt;.red[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;.red[1]&lt;/sup&gt; The term price *discrimination* has unnecessary negative moral baggage. We'll assess later today whether this type of pricing is "good" or ethical. "Variable pricing" is a more neutral term.]

- Firms .shout[segment] the market or engage in .shout[3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;-degree price discrimination] by charging different prices to different *groups* of customers

# 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;-Degree Price Discrimination: Numerical Example

.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**]: Suppose you run a bar in downtown Frederick, and estimate the demands for beer from undergraduates `\((U)\)` and graduates `\((G)\)` to be:

`$$\begin{align*}
q_U&amp;=18-4p_U\\
q_G&amp;=12-p_G\\
\end{align*}$$`

Assume the only cost of producing drinks is a constant marginal (and average) cost of $2.

]

1. If your bar could not price discriminate, and could only set one price, find the profit-maximizing quantity and price. How much profit does the bar earn?

2. If your bar can price discriminate, find the quantity and price for each group. How much profit does the bar earn?

---

# Pricing

- How much should each segment be charged?

- Firm treats each segment as a different market (set `\(MR(q)=MC(q)\)` and then raise price to max WTP)

- Lerner index implies optimal markup for each segment, again:
`$$L=\frac{p-MC(q)}{p}=-\frac{1}{\epsilon}$$`

---

# Ways to Segment Markets

.pull-left[
- By customer characteristics
  - Age
  - Gender

- Past purchase behavior
  - repeat customers (more price sensitive)

- By location
  - local demand characteristics

- Over time

# Is Price Discrimination Good or Bad? II

# Is Price Discrimination Good or Bad? III

.pull-left[

- As with markups in general, price discrimination has everything to do with **price elasticity**

- If you are paying too much and losing consumer surplus, the real "problem" is that your demand is very inelastic
  - fewer options, a particular brand, or a necessity, limited time, etc

- If you want to pay less, buy generic (elastic)

.pull-left[

- Firms often .shout[tie] multiple goods together, where you must buy both goods in order to consume the product

- This is actually a method of **intertemporal** price-discrimination!

# Tying II


.pull-left[

- Companies often sell printers at marginal cost (no markup) and sell the ink/refills at a much higher markup

- Reduce arbitrage:
  - printer requires specific ink
  - ink only words with that specific printer

- Segmenting the market into:
  - **High-volume users**: buy more ink over time; pay more per sheet printed
  - **Low-volume users**: buy less ink; pay less per sheet printed

- Indirect price-discrimination: firms don't know what kind of user you are in advance

- Again, a tradeoff between benefits and costs:

- Increased profits and reduced consumer surplus, reduced deadweight loss

- Spreads fixed cost of research &amp; development over more users

- If printers &amp; ink were not tied, printers would be more expensive, and ink cheaper
  - High-volume users would keep buying ink and save money (vs. tied)
  - Low-volume users might not buy the (now expensive) printer at all!

# Price Discrimination vs. Different Prices

- Surprisingly very hard to differentiate between price discrimination (different prices for the *same* product) and price differences (from genuine *cost differences*)

- Need to find something that changes the price elasticity of demand buy not changing the costs
