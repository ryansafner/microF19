- Macro: [modelling] Systemic interaction of choosers &amp; emergent behavior

# Economists Speak a Foreign Language...

.pull-left[

- Terms you "know" from ordinary life mean *very different things* to economists:

&gt; Cost, efficiency, welfare, competition, marginal, equilibrium, profit, public good, discrimination, elasticity

- Using these words' "ordinary" meanings will lead to wrong economic conclusions!

- You will need to "relearn" the economic meanings of these words

# ...But You Can Learn It

.pull-left[

- You'll need to master a new vocabulary:

&gt; externality, marginal rate of transformation, marginal cost, consumer surplus, allocative efficiency

- I will try to avoid jargon, but many of these concepts are useful in the real world!

# ...But You Can Learn It

# Takeaways About Incentives I

.pull-left[

- People respond to (changes in) incentives&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

- People have different goals they seek to attain

- Blocking one alternative `\(\neq\)` people stop persuing their goals

- People will seek (less preferred) alternative methods of attaining their goals

- People are creative, and many consequences are *unintended*

# Reminder: Positive vs Normative Economics

- You may vehemently disagree with certain policies, institutions, or market outcomes
- All I ask is you allow us to explain *why* they occur
- You will miss useful explanations (and the ability to improve things you disapprove of) if you are blinded by your judgment
- You may disapprove of gravity, but you are bound by it

# Why We Model I

.pull-left[

- Economists often "speak" in models that explain and predict human behavior

- The pure language of models is mathematics
    - things that are universally true, deducible from axioms, can easily spot errors
    - often equations and graphs
    - this is what scares students most about economics

# Why We Model II

.pull-left[

- Economists use conceptual models: fictional constructions to logically examine consequences

- Very different from other sciences
    - No social experiments
    - Purposive, strategic human beings 
    - Introspective understanding

&gt; "All models lie. The art is telling useful lies." - George Box

# The Two Major Models of Economics as a "Science"

.pull-left[

## Optimization

- Agents have objectives they value

- Agents face constraints

- Make tradeoffs to maximize objectives within constraints

.center[
![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qvr240t5j6t3arm/optimize.jpeg?raw=1)
]
]

--

.pull-right[

## Equilibrium

- Agents face competition from others that affect prices

- Agents adjust their behaviors based on prices

- Stable outcomes result where all agents cease adjusting

.center[
![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j7xenkgo3p71vke/equilibriumbalance.png?raw=1)
]

]

# Model 1: Optimization

.pull-left[

- .shout[Optimization]: which action(s) best achieve an *objective*? 
    - How long should I keep my old car before buying a new one?
    - Should the U.S. legalize marijuana?
    - Which college courses should I pick?
    - Which political campaign platform will win the most votes?
    - Which path minimizes travel time? 

- Find the *optimum* using .whisper[marginal analysis]

# Model 2: Equilibrium

.pull-left[

- .shout[Equilibrium]: how do stable outcomes emerge in the world (and change)? 
    - Why is there a shortage of affordable housing in big cities?
    - Why is the price of Apple iPhones so high?
    - Why is there only one provider of electricity in a city?
    - Why did the recent election turn out the way it did?

- Find the outcome where *no agents change their behavior* using .whisper[supply and demand]

# Model 3: Game Theory

.pull-left[

- .shout[Game Theory]: what outcome will we *jointly* reach if our choices are **strategic**?
    - Can big companies secretly all raise prices together?
    - Are markets with only a few sellers actually competitive?
    - How can we coordinate our actions to reduce climate change?
    - Why is doping so prevalent in professional sports?

- Find the outcome where *no agents change their behavior* (again, but slightly different!)

.red[**Caution**:] Don't conflate models with reality!

    - "...and then what?"
    - "...compared to what?"

# About This Course

# Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will: 

1. apply the models of microeconomics (constrained optimization and equilibrium) towards explaining real world behavior of individuals, firms, and governments

2. explore the effects of economic and political processes on market performance (competition, market prices, profits and losses, property rights, entrepreneurship, market power, market failures, public policy, government failures)

3. apply the economic way of thinking to real world issues in writing
