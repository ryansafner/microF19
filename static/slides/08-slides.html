# A Demand Function (Again)

.pull-left[

- A consumer's .shout[quantity demanded] (of good x), `\(q_x^D\)` is a function of their .shout[demand for good x], which depends on current market prices and their income

`$$q_x^D = D(m, p_x, p_y)$$`

- We now want to examine how **quantity demanded for x** changes as each of these parameters change:

1. .whisper[Income effects] `\(\left(\frac{\Delta q_x^D}{\Delta m}\right)\)`: how `\(q_x^D\)` changes with changes in income
2. .whisper[Cross-price effects] `\(\left(\frac{\Delta q_x^D}{\Delta p_y}\right)\)`: how `\(q_x^D\)` changes with changes in prices of *other* goods (e.g. `\(y)\)`
3. .whisper[(Own) Price effects] `\(\left(\frac{\Delta q_x^D}{\Delta p_x}\right)\)`: how `\(q_x^D\)` changes with changes in price (of `\(x)\)`

# The (Own) Price Effect

.pull-left[

- .shout[Price effect]: change in optimal consumption of a good associated with a change in its price, holding income and other prices constant

`$$\frac{\Delta q_x^D}{\Delta p_x} &lt; 0$$`


.whisper[The law of demand]: as the price of a good rises, people will tend to buy less of that good (and vice versa)
  - i.e. the price effect is negative!

# (Real) Income Effect

.pull-left[

- Suppose there is only 1 good to consume, `\(x\)`. You have a $100 income, and the price of `\(x\)` is $10. You consume 10 units of `\(x\)`

- Suppose the price of `\(x\)` falls to $5. Your now consume 20 units of `\(x\)`.

- This is the .shout[real income effect]: a change in the price of `\(x\)` changes your .onfire[real income] or .onfire[purchasing power], the amount of goods you can buy

- Note your *actual* (nominal) income of $100 never changed!

# (Real) Income Effect: Size


.pull-left[

- The *size* of the income effect depends on how large a *portion of your budget* you spend on the good

- **Large-budget items**:
    - e.g. Housing/apartment rent, car prices
    - Price increase makes you much poorer
    - Price decrease makes you much wealthier

- **Small-budget items**:
    - e.g. pencils, toothpicks, candy
    - Price changes don't have much of an effect on your wealth or change your behavior much

# Substitution Effect

.pull-left[

- Suppose there are 1000s of goods, none of them are a major fraction of your budget

- Suppose the price of one good, `\(x\)` increases

- The **real income effect** for `\(x\)` is tiny (and negative)

- But you would consume *less* of `\(x\)` relative to other goods because `\(x\)` is now *relatively* more expensive

- That's the .shout[substitution effect]: consumption changes because of a change in **relative prices**

# Putting the Effects Together

# Putting the Effects Together

- .shout[Real income effect]: change in consumption due to change in real purchasing power
    - Can be positive (**normal goods**) or negative (**inferior goods**)
    - Lower price of `\(x\)` means you can buy more `\(x\)`, `\(y\)`, or *both* (depending on your preferences between `\(x\)` and `\(y\)`)

--

- .shout[Substitution effect]: change in consumption due to change in relative prices
    - If `\(x\)` gets cheaper relative to `\(y\)`, consume  `\(\downarrow y\)` (and `\(\uparrow x\)`)
    - This is always the same direction! `\((\downarrow\)` relatively expensive goods, `\(uparrow\)` relatively cheaper goods)
    - This is why demand curves slope downwards!

the **demand function for `\(x\)`** is

- Ptroperty 2: demand for `\(x\)` is unaffected by prices of *other* goods (no `\(p_y\)` anywhere)!

# Shifts in Demand I

.pull-left[

- Note a  simple (inverse) demand function only relates (own) **price** and **quantity**

.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**]: `\(q=10-p\)` or `\(p=10-q\)`
]

- What about all the other .onfire["determinants of demand"] like income and other prices?

- They are captured in the vertical intercept (choke price)!

# Shifts in Demand II

.pull-left[

- A change in one of the .onfire["determinants of demand"] (or "shifters") will shift the demand curve
    - Change in income `\(m\)`
    - Change in price of other goods `\(p_y\)` (substitutes or complements)
    - Change in preferences or expectations about good `\(x\)` (show up in utility function)
    - Change in number of buyers in market

- Shows up in (inverse) demand function by a **change in the intercept (choke price)**!
