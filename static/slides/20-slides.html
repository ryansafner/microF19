1. Firm's products may have few close substitutes

2. .shout[Barriers to entry], making entry costly

3. Firm is a .whisper["price-searcher"]: can set optimal price `\(p^*\)` in addition to quantity `\(q^*\)`

.pull-right[

- Monopolist is constrained by relationship between quantity and price that consumers are willing to pay

- .blue[Market (inverse) demand] describes maximum price consumers are willing to pay for a given quantity

- As monopolist chooses to produce more `\(q^*\)`, must lower the price on *all* units to sell them

- .red[Price effect]: lost revenue from lowering price on all sales

- .green[Output effect]: gained revenue from increase in sales

]

---

# Monopoly and Revenues I

- If a monopolist increases output, `\(\Delta q^*\)`,  revenues would change by:

.center[

`\(R(q)=\)`.green[`\\(p \Delta q\\)`] `\(+\)` .red[`\\(q \Delta p\\)`]

]

--

- .green[Output effect]: increases number of units sold `\((\Delta q)\)` times price `\(p\)` per unit

--

- .red[Price effect]: lowers price per unit `\((\Delta p)\)` on *all* units sold `\((q)\)`

--

- Divide both sides by `\(\Delta q\)` to get .whisper[Marginal Revenue, `\\(MR(q)\\)`]:

`$$\frac{\Delta R(q)}{\Delta q}=MR(q)=p+\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta q}q$$`

--

- Compare: demand for a **competitive** firm is perfectly elastic: `\(\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta}q=0\)`, so we saw `\(MR(q)=p\)`!

---

# Monopoly and Revenues II

- If we have a linear inverse demand function of the form
`$$p=a+bq$$`
  - `\(a\)` is the choke price (intercept)
  - `\(b\)` is the slope

--

- Marginal revenue again is defined as:
`$$MR(q)=p+\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta q}q$$`

--

- Recognize that `\(\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta q}\)` is the slope, `\(b\)`, `\(\left(\frac{rise}{run} \right)\)`

--

`$$\begin{align*}
MR(q)&amp;=p+(b)q\\
MR(q)&amp;=(a+bq)+bq\\
\mathbf{MR(q)}&amp;=\mathbf{a+2bq}\\
\end{align*}$$`

MR(q)&amp;=a-2bq\\

- Marginal revenue starts at same intercept as Demand `\((a)\)` with twice the slope `\((2b)\)`

&gt; "In many market-oriented economies, government restrictions upon economic activity are pervasive facts of life. These restrictions give rise to rents of a variety of forms, and people often compete for the rents. Sometimes, such competition is perfectly legal. In other instances, rent seeking takes other forms, such as bribery, corruption, smuggling, and black markets."

&gt; "**When quantitative restrictions are imposed upon and effectively constrain imports, an import license is a valuable commodity**...It has always been recognized that there are some costs associated with licensing: paperwork, the time spent by entrepreneurs in obtaining their licenses, the cost of the administrative apparatus necessary to issue licenses, and so on. Here, the argument is carried one step further: **in many circumstances resources are devoted to competing for those licenses**," (p.848).

&gt; "Entrepreneurs should be willing to invest resources in attempts to form a monopoly until the marginal cost equals the properly discounted return. The potential customers would also be interested in preventing the transfer and should be willing to make large investments to that end. Once the monopoly is formed, continual efforts to either break the monopoly or muscle into it would be predictable. Here again considerable resources might be invested. The holders of the monopoly, on the other hand, would be willing to put quite sizable sums into the defense of their power to receive these transfers," (p.231).
