# The Two Major Models of Economics as a "Science"

.pull-left[

## Optimization

- Agents have objectives they value

- Agents face constraints

- Make tradeoffs to maximize objectives within constraints

## Equilibrium

- Agents face competition from others that affect prices

- Agents adjust their behaviors based on prices

- Stable outcomes result where all agents cease adjusting

# Consumer Behavior

- How do people decide:
    - which products to buy
    - which activities to dedicate their time to
    - how to save or invest/plan for the future

- A model of behavior we can extend to most scenarios

- Answers to these questions are building blocks for **demand curves**

- *Everyone* is a consumer
    - Recall we need not limit "goods and services" to food, clothing, etc. - theyr are *anything* that you value!

- Consumers making purchasing decisions will be our paradigmatic *example*
    - But we are really talking about how *individuals* make choices in almost *any* context!
