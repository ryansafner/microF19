- In a *competitive* market in long run equilibrium:
  - **Economic profit** is driven to $0
  - **Allocatively efficient**: `\(p=MC(q)\)` (goods produced until `\(MB=MC)\)`
  - **Productively efficient**: `\(p=AC(q)_{min}\)`, otherwise firms would enter/exit
  - .blue[Consumer surplus] and .red[producer surplus] is maximized

.pull-right[

- Now suppose the market is monopolized

- If this were instead a *competitive* market, would set `\(p=MC(q)\)` and produce 8
  - .blue[Consumer surplus] maximized

.source[Some assumptions to make the graph simple: `\\(C(q)=2q \\)`, i.e. the firm has no fixed costs, and constant marginal costs. See more information [here](http://microf19.classes.ryansafner.com/class/13-class).]

.pull-right[

- A monopolist faces the *entire* market demand and sets `\((q^o,p^o)\)`:
  - Sets .purple[`\\(MR(q)\\)`] `\(=\)` its .red[`\\(MC(q)\\)`]: 4
  - Raises price to .blue[maximum consumers are WTP (Demand)]: $6

- Restricts output and raises price, compared to competitive market

- Earns .green[monopoly profits (`\\(p&gt;AC\\)`)] 

- Loss of .blue[consumer surplus]

- Creating rents creates competition for the rents, causing people to invest resources in .shout[rent-seeking]

.pull-right[

- Political authorities intervene in markets in various ways that benefit some groups at the expense of everyone else
  - subsidies to groups (often producers)
  - regulation of industries
  - tariffs, quotas, and special exemptions from these
  - tax breaks and loopholes
  - conferring monopoly and other privileges

- These interventions create .shout[economic rents] for their beneficiaries by reducing competition

- This is a transfer of wealth from consumers/taxpayers to politically-favored groups

.right-column[

&gt; "In many market-oriented economies, government restrictions upon economic activity are pervasive facts of life. These restrictions give rise to rents of a variety of forms, and people often compete for the rents. Sometimes, such competition is perfectly legal. In other instances, rent seeking takes other forms, such as bribery, corruption, smuggling, and black markets."

&gt; "**When quantitative restrictions are imposed upon and effectively constrain imports, an import license is a valuable commodity**...It has always been recognized that there are some costs associated with licensing: paperwork, the time spent by entrepreneurs in obtaining their licenses, the cost of the administrative apparatus necessary to issue licenses, and so on. Here, the argument is carried one step further: **in many circumstances resources are devoted to competing for those licenses**," (p.848).

&gt; "The rectangle to the left of the [Deadweight loss] triangle is the income transfer that a successful monopolist can extort from the customers. **Surely we should expect that with a prize of this size dangling before our eyes, potential monopolists would be willing to invest large resources in the activity of monopolizing. In fact the investment that could be profitably made in forming a monopoly would be larger than this rectangle, since it represents merely the income transfer**," (p.231).

&gt; "Entrepreneurs should be willing to invest resources in attempts to form a monopoly until the marginal cost equals the properly discounted return. The potential customers would also be interested in preventing the transfer and should be willing to make large investments to that end. Once the monopoly is formed, continual efforts to either break the monopoly or muscle into it would be predictable. Here again considerable resources might be invested. The holders of the monopoly, on the other hand, would be willing to put quite sizable sums into the defense of their power to receive these transfers," (p.231).

.pull-left[

- Left to its own devices, a profit-maximizing monopolist finds `\(q^*: MR(q)=MC(q)\)` and raises `\(p^*\)` to Max WTP
  - Lower .blue[consumer surplus], .green[`\\(\pi\\)` for monopolist], creates **deadweight loss**
  - Compare to socially-optimal outcome ($4 at 8)

# Regulating Natural Monopolies II

.pull-left[

- Governments avoid "wasteful duplication" of competition, grant **exclusive franchises**, a single monopolist allowed in geographic region

- Provider made a **common carrier**: monopolist must provide universal service to all

- **Rate of return regulation**: gov't and monopolist agree on a price to guarantee a "modest return on capital" (i.e. some `\(\pi&gt;0)\)`
  - Attempting to `\(\uparrow q\)` and `\(\downarrow p\)`
  - Prohibition on price discrimination, enforced subsidies
