# Ceterus Paribus I

.pull-left[

- Supply function and demand function relate *quantity* (supplied or demanded) to *price* **only**
  - Describes how buyers/sellers respond to changes in market price

- Certainly there are many *other* factors that influence how much a buyer or seller will purchase at a particular price!
  - income, preferences, prices of other goods, expectations, etc.

- A supply or demand function (or graph) requires .shout["ceterus paribus"] (all else equal)

# Recall (for example), Demand I

.pull-left[

- A consumer's .shout[quantity demanded] (of good x), `\(q_x^D\)` is a function of their .shout[demand for good x], which depends on current market prices and their income

`$$q_x^D = D(m, p_x, p_y)$$`

1. .whisper[Income effects] `\(\left(\frac{\Delta q_x^D}{\Delta m}\right)\)`: how `\(q_x^D\)` changes with changes in income
2. .whisper[Cross-price effects] `\(\left(\frac{\Delta q_x^D}{\Delta p_y}\right)\)`: how `\(q_x^D\)` changes with changes in prices of *other* goods (e.g. `\(y)\)`
3. .whisper[(Own) Price effects] `\(\left(\frac{\Delta q_x^D}{\Delta p_x}\right)\)`: how `\(q_x^D\)` changes with changes in price (of `\(x)\)`

# Recall (for example), Demand II

.pull-left[

- A change in one of the .whisper["determinants of demand"] (or "shifters") will shift the demand curve
    - Change in income `\(m\)`
    - Change in price of other goods `\(p_y\)` (substitutes or complements)
    - Change in preferences or expectations about good `\(x\)` (show up in utility function)
    - Change in number of buyers in market

- Shows up in (inverse) demand function by a **change in the intercept (choke price)**!

# Ceterus Paribus II

.pull-left[

- Consider our demand function:
`$$q_D=10-p$$`

- If the **market price `\((p)\)` changes** (perhaps because supply changes), that results in a **change in _quantity demanded_ `\((q_D)\)`**
  - We move *along* the existing demand curve

- *Ceterus paribus* has not been violated

- Consider our demand function:

  - We need to draw a new demand curve (or demand function)

`$$q_D=12-p$$`

# Elasticities and Surpluses II

.pull-left[

- A good visual rule of thumb:

- Compare distance between choke price and `\(p^*\)` for each curve

- Bigger distance `\(\implies\)` *less* elastic in equilibrium (and vice versa)
  - `\(\implies\)` more surplus

# Example

.content-box-green[
.green[**Example**]: Using last class's supply and demand functions:

`$$\begin{align*}
	q_D&amp;=10-p\\
	q_S&amp;=2p-8\\	
	\end{align*}$$`
]

1. Calculate the price elasticity of demand and the price elasticity of supply in equilibrium.

2. Calculate the consumer surplus and producer surplus. Shade each on the graph.

3. Who gets more surplus, consumers or producers, and why?
