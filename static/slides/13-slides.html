- Costs in economics are different from common conception of "cost"
    - **Accounting cost**: monetary cost

- Helpful to consider two points of view:
  - **"Accounting point of view"**: are you taking in more cash than you are spending?

# Opportunity Costs

- Each choice incurs an opportunity cost

.green[**Examples**]:
- If you choose to start a business, you may give up your salary at your current job
- If you invest in a factory, you give up other investment opportunities
- If you use an office building you own, you cannot rent it to other people

# Costs in the Short Run

- .shout[Total cost function, `\\(C(q)\\)`] relates output `\(q\)`&lt;sup&gt;.red[1]&lt;/sup&gt; to the total cost of production `\(C\)`

`$$C(q)=f+VC(q)$$`

- Two kinds of costs:

**1.** .shout[Fixed costs, `\\(f\\)`] are costs that do not vary with output
  - Only true in the short run! (Consider this the cost of maintaining your capital)

--

**2.** .shout[Variable costs, `\\(VC(q)\\)`] are costs that vary with output (notice the variable in them!)
  - Typically, the more production of `\(q\)`, the higher the cost
  - e.g. firm is hiring *additional* labor

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;.red[1]&lt;/sup&gt; Using optimal combinations of `\\(l\\)` and `\\(k\\)`!]

# Fixed vs. Sunk costs

.pull-left[
- What is the difference between *fixed* and *sunk* costs?

- Sunk costs are a *type* of fixed cost that are *not* avoidable or recoverable

- Many fixed costs can be avoided or changed in the long run

- Common *fixed*, but *not sunk*, costs:
  - rent for office space
  - durable equipment
  - operating permits (that are renewed)

- When deciding to stay in business, fixed costs matter, sunk costs do not!

# Average Costs

# Marginal Cost

- Calculus: first derivative of the cost function

- In the long run, firm can change all factors of production, and vary the scale of production

- **Long run average cost, LRAC(q)**: cost per unit of output when the firm can change both `\(l\)` and `\(k\)` to make more `\(q\)`

- **Long run marginal cost, LRMC(q)**: change in long run total cost as the firm produce an additional unit of `\(q\)` (by changing both `\(l\)` and/or `\(k\)`)
